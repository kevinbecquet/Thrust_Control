# Process

The implementation of the thrust controller is divided in four main steps :  
* Receive the command sent by the PixHawks
* Recieve the force values sent by the loadcell
* Create the controller determining the signal to send to the ESC
* Sending the desired signal to the ESC


## Receiving the command sent by the PixHawks


## Recieving the force values sent by the loadcell



## Create the controller determining the signal to send to the ESC




## Sending the desired signal to the ESC

Before even sending any signal to the ESC, it is necessary to calibrate this component in order to get the reaction we want from the sent signal.

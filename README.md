# Implementation of a Thrust Controller for a Drone Motor


## Summary


The goal of this project was to implement a controller allowing to control a drone using the thrust of its motors.  
To do so, this project is divided in **four main steps**:

* Acquisition of the thrust produced by the motor
* Acquisition of the command sent to the ESC
* Sending a signal to the ESC
* Creation of a controller to close the loop


# Material list: 

* OpenCM 9.04 MCU board
* BLDC motor 
* Full Wheatstone bridge loadcell
* AD620 analog voltage amplifier module
* 2kÎ© resistor
* 333 nF capacitor
